# AirBaltic Passenger Satisfaction dataset

In this analysis, I use **Python** (with `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `scikit-learn`) to answer questions about passenger satisfaction with AirBaltic.  
The goal is to understand which factors influence satisfaction and how different aspects of the travel experience impact customers.

## Key Research Questions

- Does the type of customer (Loyal vs. Disloyal) affect satisfaction?  
- Is there a correlation between flight distance and passenger satisfaction?  
- Does travel class (Business, Eco, Eco Plus) significantly influence satisfaction?  
- Do onboard services (seat comfort, entertainment, wifi, food & drink) have a stronger impact than ground services (check-in, baggage, gate location)?  
- Do delays (departure/arrival) negatively affect satisfaction, and which type of delay has more impact?  
- What is the demographic distribution (age, gender) of satisfied vs. dissatisfied passengers?  
- Which factors are most predictive of overall satisfaction, and what can airlines improve?  
- Does the purpose of travel (Business vs Personal) influence passenger satisfaction differently across travel classes?  
- Which service factors (onboard vs ground) are most important predictors of dissatisfaction (neutral/dissatisfied passengers)?
